          The administration system in the Kingdom of Buganda was heavily
          reliant on clans. Every person belonged to one, and children
          automatically inherited their father's clan. Members were not allowed
          to intermarry within the clan, and duties were assigned based on
          membership. Additionally, each clan had reserved names, which were
          essential for identification. Therefore, many Baganda can easily
          recognize the name Katerega/Kateregga (spelling varies/disputed) as
          belonging to the royal clan.
